## Getting Started
This project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) for package management.
Installation instructions for Yarn can be found [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

Once you have Yarn, you can install all the other dependencies by running the following command in your command line.

```
yarn install
```

To get the project running locally, we use Yarn again to trigger a webpack build.

```
yarn start
```

This will run through all the nessesary build steps and create a development server at [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080).
